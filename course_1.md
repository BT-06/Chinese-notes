In modern spoken Mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is. The 20th century [`Yuen Ren Chao`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuen_Ren_Chao) poem *[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den)* exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced *"`shi`"*. As such, most of these words have been replaced in speech, if not in writing, with less ambiguous disyllabic compounds. Only the first one, 十 , normally appears in monosyllabic form in spoken Mandarin; the rest are normally used in the polysyllabic forms of

Later Taoists incorporated concepts from the I Ching, like *`tiān`* (heaven). According to `Livia Kohn`, `tiān` is "a process, an abstract representation of the cycles and patterns of nature, a nonhuman force that interacted closely with the human world in a nonpersonal way."

#### [Pronounce Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin)

> [Tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin)

The pinyin system also uses diacritics to mark the four tones of Mandarin (or it could be five tones when considering the neutral tone).

In the pinyin system, four main tones of Mandarin are shown by diacritics: `ā, á, ǎ, and à`. And there is no symbol or diacritic for the neutral tone, `a`.
